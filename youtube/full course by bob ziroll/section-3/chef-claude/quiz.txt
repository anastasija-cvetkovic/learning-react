1. You have 2 options for what you can pass in to a state setter function (e.g. `setCount`).What are they?
  1) Pass the new version of the state that we want to use as the replacement for the old version of the state.
  2) Pass a callback function. Must return what we want the new value of state to be. Will receive the old version of state as a parameter so we can use it to help determine wht we want the new value of state to be.

2. When would you want to pass the first option (from answer above) to the state setter function?
  Whenever we don't really care about (or need) the old value, we simply want to set a new table.

3. When would you want to pass the second option (from answer above) to the state setter function?
  Whenever we care about the previous value in state and need it to help us determine what the new value should be.
