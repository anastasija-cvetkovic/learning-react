1. What do props help us accomplish?
	Make a component more reusable(like parameters to a method).

2. How do you pass a prop into a component?
	In the same way that an attribute is passed to an HTML element.
	<MyAwesomeHeader title="" />

3. Can I pass a custom prop(e.g. `blablabla={true}`) to a native DOM element? 
(e.g. <div blablabla={true}>) Why or why not?
	No. The JSX we use to describe native DOM elements will be turned into
	real DOM elements by React. Real DOM elements only have the properties
	/attributes specified in the HTML specification. 
	(Which doesn't include properties like `blablabla`)

4. How do I receive props in a component?
function Navbar(){
	return(
		<header>
			...
		</header>
	)
}
	function Navbar(props) 
	We could name props anything we want, but by a very strong convention
	it should be props.

5. What data type is `props` when the component receives it?
	It's an object.
